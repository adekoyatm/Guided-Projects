About
Javascript is a versatile programming language that found its roots in web development. However, using some interesting runtimes like NodeJS, JavaScript can be used for all kinds of applications. Today, JavaScript can be used both for dynamic web pages and non-web contexts. This could include anything from web apps to server applications to games.

Being one of the core technologies of the world wide web, it is widely used for client-side web page behaviour. With several frameworks built on top of it and with continuous improvements, JavaScript continues to be one of the most widely adopted modern languages. By learning JavaScript not only do you gain access to several powerful libraries and frameworks but you also gain a deeper understanding of how the modern web works.

In this hands-on project you will be recreating the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using JavaScript in IBM's cloud based environment. Through the project, you will use JavaScript to manipulate the web page to simulate game play. In addition, You will employ functions, objects and event handlers to handle all the game logic behind the scenes and deliver a seamless experience.
