At a Glance
This Guided Project will walk you through some of the applications of Hugging Face Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Hugging Face Transformers provide pre-trained models for a variety of applications in NLP and Computer Vision. For example, these models are widely used in near real-time translation tasks, opening communication spaces to language-diverse and hearing-impaired audiences. In this project, you will learn and practice applying these models to do text summarization, sentiment classification, translation, generate new text, and extract information from text.

Why you should do this Guided Project
This Guided Project will introduce you to a simple way of performing various text analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, translating a text from one language to another, generating and summarizing text.


A Look at the Project Ahead
After completing this project, you will be able to use pre-trained transformer models to

  - perform text classification, such as sentiment analysis
  - perform topic classification  
  - generate some text 
  - perform token classification, such as Name Entity Recognition (NER)
  - extract some information by doing question answering analysis
  - do text summarization
  - translate text from one language to another
